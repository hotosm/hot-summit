As CEO, Ian oversees the technology strategy and development capacity at Development Seed. Ian has a rich history of building teams and communities at the intersection of technology and human rights. Ian was a founding member of the National Democratic Institute’s Information and Communications Technology team and went on to build Internet Freedom Programs at the State Department’s Bureau for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor where he oversaw the growth of the program's portfolio from $20 million to over $100 million.
