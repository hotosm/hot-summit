The Missing Maps project has seen considerable success in the engagement of new mappers. The vast majority of this engagement is at mapathons. The journey they have taken to arrive at Missing Maps has not come by way of OSM, or even mapping. However, they are committed to humanitarian idea, understand the benefits of the project and they want to contribute. The challenge we are facing is scaling this model. Already, we cannot find venues in London that can cater for the people that want to attend, and hundreds of individuals have expressed a desire to attend mapping events in places we cannot organise them. During this session, we would like to explore ideas and experiences from the HOT community on mass engagement of new mappers in both the physical and virtual realm, including motivation, training, support, validation and development.
