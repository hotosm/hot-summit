"In Kibera, a slum in Nairobi, Kenya, there are around 350 schools - nearly all of which are considered informal or outside the public school system. We know this because we mapped them, one at a time. OpenSchoolsKenya.org, Map Kibera along with GroundTruth Initiative, Development Gateway and contributions from Development Seed, presents a map of each school and its data in a simple profile format. The information, housed in OSM, includes data ranging from number of teachers to school fees to building materials, photos and more. Attendees will hear about our experinces and how we think this approach could be adopted, across various sectors, to keep OSM data fresh and bring information access right down to the grassroots.
